        Hi there, my name is Ansh Chabra and I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science from Lovely Professional University. As an engineering student, 
        I've gained a deep understanding of the principles and practices that underpin the field of computer science. However, my real passion lies in <strong>full stack
        web development.</strong> I'm fascinated by the way that front-end and back-end technologies work together to create dynamic and responsive web applications, and
        I'm constantly exploring new frameworks and languages to expand my skills. In pursuit of my goal of becoming a full stack web developer, I've taken on a
         number of projects both inside and outside of the classroom.
        <br>
        <br>
        I enjoy working collaboratively with others to bring ideas to life, and I'm always eager to learn from more experienced developers in the field. Overall, 
        I'm a driven and focused individual who is committed to achieving my goals and making a positive impact in the world of web development. Thank you for 
        taking the time to get to know me a bit better, and I look forward to connecting with others who share my passion for this exciting and rapidly-evolving field.
